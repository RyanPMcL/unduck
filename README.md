## I'm feeling Quacky!

Google calls it "I'm feeling Lucky".  
DuckDuckGo calls it "Ducky".  

Simply append or prepend an exclamation mark to the search term.
```
! <query> or <query> !

## Why is this the best version of Unduck?

More feature rich than the original by theo/t3.  
I'm not "debugging in prod cuz why not lol", because I rely on this working daily.  

## Problems?
