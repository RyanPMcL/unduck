DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow. We fix them.  
Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser.  
Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.

## I am feeling [Quacky](https://quacky-gamma.vercel.app/)!

Google calls it "I am feeling Lucky".  
DuckDuckGo calls it "Ducky".  
You get the idea.  
We scrape DuckDuckGo's results and redirect the user.  
No data collected. Pure Luck (Algorithms).  
Also, it is not completely broken. (*cough* *cough* Google *cough*)

## How is this any better than DuckDuckGo or the original Unduck?

Couple of stuff:
 - Faster ⚡
 - Looks better 💄
 - Choose a default bang (Enables default search for over 13,000 websites) 🙌
 - Animations (Because it's Animations.) 📺
 - Why the f*ck did theo censor the Duck part in Unduck? (oooo wait i get it now) 🤬
 - No data collected. At all. 📅
 - i- it- it- its just better. pliz use 🥲

## We care about you. Big Companies don't.
